        <p>Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term for cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan, distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance, and supernatural forces. Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. The art style connected with anime is distinct and easily identifiable. Large eyes, untamed hair, lengthy arms and limbs, and other features are certainly known to you. This exaggerated design allows the characters to convey their emotions more freely, which is plentiful in anime.</p>

        <p>NAGATO UZUMAKI<br>
            He intended on stopping the world from entering into wars that led to mass genocide. However, all of that changed when Nagato witnessed his friend Yahiko die. His views on war changed, and he was submerged in hatred and sought vengeance Nagato was the son of Fuso and Ise, born into the renowned Uzumaki clan. He lived with his parents on the outskirts of the Hidden Rain Village. Madara Uchiha, also known as the Ghost of the Uchiha, sneaked in and transplanted his Rinnegan into Nagato when he was very young, without his parents ever noticing.

        <h1>MADARA UCHIHA</h1>
        <p>As a child, Madara strived to make a world safe for his family and believed that peace could be attained by coming to an understanding with his enemies, hence his friendship with Hashirama who shared his ideals. Even at this time though, he was already very pompous, domineering and boastful.Madara turned evil because Black Zetsu managed to alter a message of warning to the Uchiha that convinced Madara that the only way to peace was through the Infinite Tsukuyomi which would actually just release Kaguya and capture everyone for her to use as she pleased.</p>
